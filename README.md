# EDA-Insights
Overview:


This project demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), a key step in understanding datasets.
EDA helps reveal patterns, detect anomalies, and prepare data for further analysis, often using data visualization techniques.

Key Features of EDA:

Data Summarization: Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions.

Visualization: Histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps.

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers.

Pattern Detection: Identifying trends, correlations, and relationships.

Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting important variables for models.

Advantages:
Provides a clear understanding of data.
Helps identify data quality issues.
Guides decision-making and model building.
